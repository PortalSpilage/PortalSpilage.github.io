<p class="p">Smithe is an artist from México who is influenced by old local comics, graphic style of the 50's and Sci-Fi movies. At the age of 13 he painted graffiti just for fun and as a hobby. As an autodidactic evolutionist with an attraction to fine art, Smithe is constantly reinventing his style. Over the past years the subjects of his work have explored different themes such as Existentialism, Individuality of the human being and the machine within.</p>
<p class="p">Defragmentation, a common symbol in his work, is used as a vehicle to show the inner elements that power his characters and is shown as a surrealistic machine. Smithe is commonly known for his graffiti, but is also involved in other artistic areas such as illustration, design, sculpture and music. He has exhibited in Japan, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Spain, USA, and Mexico.</p> 
<p class="p">SMITHE ONE has been living the artistic dream in the most exciting of ways. Having had to overcome the doubt of succeeding as a freelancer, he is now riding a wave of fame and high-profile collaborations as his talent and creativity are spreading across the globe.</p>
<p class="p">Mexico City, the artist’s hometown, is full of spots where art lovers can view artwork by SMITHE ONE. In 2011, Vertigo, Mexico marked the young artist’s first gallery opening. Later he was featured in the Scope Art Show in Miami. New York City became the destination of the largest Smithe mural work to date. This mural art instillation is only one of many which span the globe from Honolulu to Berlin and of course Mexico City. His collaboration in 2015 with Pharrell Williams for the Adidas Original Superstars campaign has further cemented Smithe artwork into the creative world. It is evident the artist has a promising future ahead of him.</p>
