 <h2 class="heading">The Abstract creative</h2>
 <p class="pp">Welcome to the The Abstract Collective! My name is Zack Starensier and here I have designed a website that is meant to showcase a variety of my personal favorite abstract artists. Click on each artists name to dive deeper into who they are, along with that I have showcased a few of my favorite pieces from each artist. Once you are one the selected artists page you can click on their name that sits above the bio section that will then direct you to their personal website. ENJOY! </p>
 
  <h2 class="heading">What is Abstract Art?</h2>
  <p class="pp">  The definition. Abstraction literally means the distancing of an idea from objective referents. That means, in the visual arts, pulling a depiction away from any literal, representational reference points. You can also call abstract art nonrepresentational art.</p> 

<h2 class="heading">The Highlights</h2>
<p class = "pp">The first signs. Abstraction can be traced to Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Cubism. All three helped realize the idea that art could be non-representative.

The movement. Modern abstract art was born early in the 20th century. It was completely radical for its day. Artists began to create simplified objections with little or no reference to the “real” world.

The father. The first artist to create abstract art as we know it will always remain a mystery but Wassily Kandinsky is often credited by historians as he created paintings of floating, norepresentational forms as early as 1912. His work brought abstraction to America during the Armory Show in 1913.

The present. Abstract art now lives in the art world in many forms. It is two- and three-dimensional. It can be vast or small. Abstract art can also be made with many materials and on many surfaces. It can be used in concert with representational art or completely abstract. Artists creating it often focus on other visual qualities like color, form, texture, scale and more in their nonobjective work.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Why Should I Care?</h2>
<p class="pp">The continuing interest in abstract art lies in its ability to inspire our curiosity about the reaches of our imagination and the potential for us to create something completely unique in the world.

  A major obstacle to making an abstract artwork is the barrier in your mind that questions whether abstract art is a legitimate art form—legitimate for you at least. This block may be because you still wonder, “Is abstract art really ‘art’ at all?” Possibly you think you have to master realism before you can work abstractly? Or it could be that you worry your friends and family won’t approve?</p>
