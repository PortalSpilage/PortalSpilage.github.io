    <h1 class="bio"><a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/omegatbs/">OMEGATBS</a></h1>
<p class="a">I was born and live in Valencia.  We could say that I have been drawing all of my life, since I was a child.  Back then I have already created superheroes, warriors, monsters, football players, designs for sneakers, terrorist groups…  Drawing has  always been all for me.  More than a way to earn my living, for me it’s a way to understand life.  I have studied a degree in arts where I met TBS Crew and since 2006 I started to paint graffiti.  Before that I already started to use the name of Omega as I had the need to use an alter ego. I always liked the symbolism of Omega and the fact that I can use it like an icon.</p>
<p class="a">Mainly, my works consist of handmade illustrations in paper with ink and watercolors, but also I like to work with photoshop or acrylic painting on canvas.  I see walls like a big support that takes part in the space, takes over the street and captures the attention of people passing by.  Also part of the magic of painting in the street is the excuse to meet friends, make some work together, have fun and share the last creations we have done. That is very different from working alone in the studio. </p> 
<p class="a">In the wall my characters are influenced by the works I do at my Studio, where I work in a more detailed and intensive way. I’m interested in people, regardless there are not very human, the faces, the clothing, the hands, the skins, the spaces where they move… In summary: to show the darkest side of things and been able to laugh to it, showing it all in a funny way. </p>
<p class="a">My method is working without any schetch, nor having a preconceived idea, improvising depending on the size of the wall and the paint that I have. I like to have freedom to better adapt it, without having to stick to the sketch.</p>
